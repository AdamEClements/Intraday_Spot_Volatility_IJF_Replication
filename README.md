# Intraday_Spot_Volatility_IJF_Replication
For replicating the IBM results for 'Modeling and Forecasting Intraday Spot Volatility'

Each section below relates to sets of results in the paper. There is a folder in the repository (with the same name as each section) that contains the relevant data, code and output.

## Data
Raw data file: IBM.N5MinuteOHLC.csv

Use sort_5minute_data.m (used Matlab 2024b) to filter the raw 5-minute data

Output for the 5-minute OK volatility is written to IBM_5minvol_Win.mat to use in subsequent Matlab code

5-minute OK volatility is laos stored in IBM_ok.csv

## In-sample and Figure 1

intravol_model.m provides the full sample estimation results.

intravol_model.m uses IBM_5minvol_Win.mat

Writes out coefficient estimates (IBM_OLS_estimates.csv) and robust covariance matrix 
(IBM_robust_scaled_covars.csv) to produce Figure 1

These files are used in the R code in IBM_HAC_based_plots.qmd to generate Figure 1
IBM_HAC_based_plots.qmd needs the dplyr readr libraries.

## Residual ACF plots in Figure 2

Resiuduals for miHAR model
IBM_miHAR_resids.csv is generated by intravol_model.m

Residuals for diHAR model
IBM_miHAR_resids.csv is generated by intravol_seasHAR_model.m

Resdiduals for liGBM
IBM_gbm_resid.csv is generated by gbm_residuals2.py

Resdiduals for LSTM
IBM_LSTM_resid.csv is generated by residuals_LSTM.m

get_ACF.r uses the files above to generate ACFs and output to SACFs.csv

SACFs.qmd uses SACFs.csv to generate Figure 2 needs the dplyr readr libraries
